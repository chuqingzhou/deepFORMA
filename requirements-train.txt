# Training-only dependencies (includes PyTorch).
# Install PyTorch first according to your platform, then:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   pip install -r requirements-train.txt
#
# Or for training from scratch:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch   # or cu121 for CUDA
#   pip install -r requirements-train.txt
#
# Note: requirements-train.txt extends requirements.txt.
# The train script (train_transformer_kfold.py) requires PyTorch.
# No additional packages beyond base + torch are needed for training.
